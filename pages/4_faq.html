            <br />
            <br />
              Occupational therapy focuses on enabling people to do the activities of daily life. The very word &quot;occupation&quot; - means an activity which &quot;occupies&quot; our time. A child in grade school has the occupation of learning. An adult may need to learn how to write after a traumatic injury. A senior may want to continue driving safely in order to stay active in their community. All of these things are occupations and participating in them is vital to maintaining overall health and wellness.

            <br />
            Depending on the causes, any child who is having difficulty functioning or participating in their lives as student, friend, family/home member and/or typically developing young person may be a good candidate for OT intervention. Pediatric OTs work with children of all ages, from birth through young adulthood.<br />

            <span class="style1">OT is unique, in that intervention is based on improving function, rather than on focusing on a particular diagnosis. Each child has their own challenges, strengths and goals, so therapy focuses on the gains the child needs to make to be a more successful participant in home, school and community environments. Although OTs often work with children without a diagnosed medical issue, children with the following conditions are typical of the clients an OT may see:                        </span><br />

          </p>
          <p class="style1">
            “Sensory integration is the organization of sensation for use. Our senses give us information about the physical conditions of our body and the environment around us…. The brain must organize all of these sensations if a person is to move and learn and behave normally. The brain locates, sorts, and orders sensations—somewhat as a traffic policeman directs moving cars. When sensations flow in a well-organized manner, the brain can use those sensations to form perceptions, behaviors, and learning.  When the flow of sensations is disorganized, life can be like a rush hour traffic jam.”

          <p class="style1">“The condition increasingly known as Sensory Processing Disorder was first recognized in the mid-1900s and was originally called sensory integration dysfunction. Dr. A. Jean Ayres was an American occupational therapist, educational psychologist, and neuroscientist who pioneered the study of the disorder…. She theorized that when sensory processing is impaired in a child—where there is a ‘sensory integrative dysfunction’—social, emotional, motor, and/or functional problems can result.” <br /><br />

            Self-regulation is the nervous system’s ability to attain, maintain and change levels of arousal or alertness (Williams &amp; Shellenberger, 1994). Self-regulation is the result of sensory integration, and a state of being that optimizes a child’s ability to attend and learn.<br /><br />
